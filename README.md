todo list test application

## TASK

Develop a React application incorporating a TODO list, API interaction,
pagination, CRUD operations, custom design, state management through
Redux or Local Storage, with optional responsive design and Docker
containerization.

Steps to Complete:

- Setting up the React Project:
- Create a new React application using Create React App or any other
  tools of your choice.
- Initialize a git repository and commit the changes.
- Fetching TODO List from an API:

* Choose any API for retrieving a list of tasks (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
* Integrate the received data into the application.

- Implementing Pagination:

* Implement pagination to manage the display of the task list.
* Provide navigation between pages and display the total number of
  pages.

- CRUD Operations in TODO:
  - Implement functionality for adding, deleting, and editing tasks.
  - Update the interface accordingly when changes occur in the data.
- Custom Design:
  - Create a design for the TODO list and control elements.
  - Use styling with CSS or any tool of your choice.
  - State Management via Redux or Local Storage:
- Decide whether to use global state management through Redux or
  local state through Local Storage.
- Implement the saving of task state according to the chosen approach.
- Additional Options (Optional):
  - Implement responsive design for proper display on different devices.
    Project Documentation:
- Installation and Launch:
  - Provide instructions for installing dependencies and launching the
    project.
- Repository Link:
  - Provide a link to the git repository containing the complete project
    code.

Notes:

- Code should be well-structured and accompanied by comments.
- Documentation can be presented as a README.md file in the root of the
  repository.
